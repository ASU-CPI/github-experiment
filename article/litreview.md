Opening Science: The Evolving Guide on How the Web is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing. Edited by Sönke Bartling & Sascha Friesike.
[http://book.openingscience.org/](http://book.openingscience.org/) and
[https://github.com/openingscience/book](https://github.com/openingscience/book)
Abstract: This book will give researchers, scientists, decision makers, politicians, and stakeholders an overview on the basics, the tools, and the vision behind the current changes we see in the field of knowledge creation. It is meant as a starting point for readers to become an active part in the future of research and to become an informed party during the transition phase. This is pivotal, since research, as a sensitive, complex process with many facets and millions of participants, hierarchies, personal networks, and structures, needs informed participants.

Exploring the ecosystem of software developers on GitHub and other platforms
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556483&dl=ACM&coll=DL](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556483&dl=ACM&coll=DL)
Abstract: GitHub provides various social features for developers to collaborate with others. Those features are important for developers to coordinate their work (Dabbish et al., 2012; Marlow et al., 2013). We hypothesized that the social system of GitHub users was bound by system interactions such that contributing to similar code repositories would lead to users following one another on GitHub or vice versa. Using a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlation, however, only a weak correlation among followship and production activities (code, issue, and wiki contributions) was found. Survey with GitHub users revealed an ecosystem on the Internet for software developers, which includes many platforms, such as Forrst, Twitter, and Hacker News, among others. Developers make social introductions and other interactions on these platforms and engage with one anther on GitHub. Due to these preliminary findings, we describe GitHub as a part of a larger ecosystem of developer interactions.

Impression Formation in Online Peer Production: Activity Traces and Personal Profiles in GitHub
[http://herbsleb.org/web-pubs/pdfs/marlow-impression-2013.pdf](http://herbsleb.org/web-pubs/pdfs/marlow-impression-2013.pdf)
Abstract: In this paper we describe a qualitative investigation of impression formation in an online distributed software development community with social media functionality. We find that users in this setting seek out additional information about each other to explore the project space, inform future interactions, and understand the potential future value of a new person. They form impressions around other users’ expertise based on history of activity across projects, and successful collaborations with key high status projects in the community. These impressions influence their receptivity to strangers’ work contributions.

The Increasing Dominance of Teams in Production of Knowledge
[http://www.sciencemag.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/content/316/5827/1036.short](http://www.sciencemag.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/content/316/5827/1036.short)
Abstract: We have used 19.9 million papers over 5 decades and 2.1 million patents to demonstrate that teams increasingly dominate solo authors in the production of knowledge. Research is increasingly done in teams across nearly all fields. Teams typically produce more frequently cited research than individuals do, and this advantage has been increasing over time. Teams now also produce the exceptionally high-impact research, even where that distinction was once the domain of solo authors. These results are detailed for sciences and engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities, and patents, suggesting that the process of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed.

Coordinating the Commons: Diversity & Dynamics in Open Collaborations
[https://dlib.lib.washington.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1773/25074/Morgan_washington_0250E_12422.pdf?sequence=1](https://dlib.lib.washington.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1773/25074/Morgan_washington_0250E_12422.pdf?sequence=1)
Abstract: The success of Wikipedia demonstrates that open collaboration can be an effective model for organizing geographically- distributed volunteers to perform complex, sustained work at a massive scale. However, Wikipedia’s history also demonstrates some of the challenges that large, long-term open collaborations face: the core community of Wikipedia editors—the volunteers who contribute most of the encyclopedia’s content and ensure that articles are correct and consistent—has been gradually shrinking since 2007, in part because Wikipedia’s social climate has become increasingly inhospitable for new- comers, female editors, and editors from other underrepresented demographics. Previous research studies of change over time within other work contexts, such as corporations, suggests that incremental processes such as bureaucratic formalization can make organizations more rule-bound and less adaptable—in effect, less open—as they grow and age. There has been little research on how open collaborations like Wikipedia change over time, and on the impact of those changes on the social dynamics of the collaborating community and the way community members prioritize and perform work. Learning from Wikipedia’s successes and failures can help researchers and designers understand how to support open collaborations in other domains—such as Free/Libre Open Source Software, Citizen Science, and Citizen Journalism. In this dissertation, I examine the role of openness, and the potential antecedents and consequences of formalization, within Wikipedia through an analysis of three distinct but interrelated social structures: community-created rules within the Wikipedia policy environment, coordination work and group dynamics within self-organized open teams called WikiProjects, and the socialization mechanisms that Wikipedia editors use to teach new community members how to participate. To inquire further, I have designed a new editor peer support space, the Wikipedia Teahouse, based on the findings from my empirical studies. The Teahouse is a volunteer-driven project that provides a welcoming and engaging environment in which new editors can learn how to be productive members of the Wikipedia community, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of newcomers who go on to make substantial contributions to Wikipedia.

True Collective Intelligence? A Sketch of a Possible New Field
[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-013-0146-3](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-013-0146-3)
Abstract: Collective intelligence is much talked about but remains very underdeveloped as a field. There are small pockets in computer science and psychology and fragments in other fields, ranging from economics to biology. New networks and social media also provide a rich source of emerging evidence. However, there are surprisingly few useable theories, and many of the fashionable claims have not stood up to scrutiny. The field of analysis should be how intelligence is organised at large scale—in organisations, cities, nations and networks. The paper sets out some of the potential theoretical building blocks, suggests an experimental and research agenda, shows how it could be analysed within an organisation or business sector and points to the possible intellectual barriers to progress.

Social coding in GitHub: transparency and collaboration in an open software repository
[http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/citation.cfm?id=2145396](http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/citation.cfm?id=2145396)
Abstract: Social applications on the web let users track and follow the activities of a large number of others regardless of location or affiliation. There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation.

“Who connects with whom? A social network analysis of an online open source software community” by Cuihua Shen and Peter Monge
[http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3551/2991](http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3551/2991)
Abstract: By examining “who connects with whom” in an online community using social network analysis, this study tests the social drivers that shape the collaboration dynamics among a group of participants from SourceForge, the largest open source community on the Web. The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance–based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.
