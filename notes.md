#Notes on Creating, Maintaining, Participating in and Completing this Experiment
version 0.1.1

This is a place for recording observations on the conduct of this experiment. Please add to this. Observations are currently in no particular order:

- setting up the structure prior to launch took a lot of time. Right before launching, the repos were forked for the Honest-PI and GitHub Experiment to have them available for re-use.
- the structure for the article was broken up into individual files and placed in its own [folder](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/tree/master/article) to make it easier to manage.
- assumption is that a [master version](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/blob/master/article/article.md) of the complete article will be published once per week during the experiment.
- [licensing](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/blob/master/licensing.md) was establish, but no CLA was implemented (too legalistic and would likely have reduced participation). 
- contributors were solicited through an open call (e.g., via the [CPI blog](https://cpi.asu.edu/honest-github-experiment), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASU_CPI/statuses/451014461873487872), etc.) and targeted invitations.
- the management of contributions was left undefined. A PMC (project management committee) consisted of [one collaborator](https://github.com/JustinLongo) at project start, with the anticipation that additional members would be added.
- sectioning the article made referencing difficult
- GitHub [removed the internal private messaging function in April 2012](https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning). Interesting rationale. So contributor-to-contributor communication will have to be by email.
