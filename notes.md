#Notes on Creating, Maintaining, Participating in and Completing this Experiment
version 0.1.1

This is a place for recording observations on the conduct of this experiment. Please add to this. Observations are currently in no particular order:

- setting up the structure prior to launch took a lot of time. Right before launching, the repos were forked for the Honest-PI and GitHub Experiment to have them available for re-use.
- the structure for the article was broken up into individual files and placed in its own [folder](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/tree/master/article) to make it easier to manage.
- assumption is that a [master version](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/blob/master/article/article.md) of the complete article will be published once per week during the experiment.
- [licensing](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/blob/master/licensing.md) was establish, but no CLA was implemented (too legalistic and would likely have reduced participation). 
- contributors were solicited through an open call (e.g., via the [CPI blog](https://cpi.asu.edu/honest-github-experiment), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASU_CPI/statuses/451014461873487872), etc.) and targeted invitations.
- the management of contributions was left undefined. A PMC (project management committee) consisted of [one collaborator](https://github.com/JustinLongo) at project start, with the anticipation that additional members would be added.
- sectioning the article made referencing difficult
- GitHub [removed the internal private messaging function in April 2012](https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning). Interesting rationale. So contributor-to-contributor communication will have to be by email. 
- One way that GitHub is better than wikis is that two people can work on the same file at the same time and those changes can be merged after the fact. This is fine when people are contributing different things to the same file. But if two of us work on the references at the same time, this will just be duplicated effort. So what's a good practice to follow: "check out" files?
