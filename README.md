This [article](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/tree/master/article) documents an experiment in collaborative group writing of an [academic article](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi). 

Rather than deciding beforehand who the list of authors will be and then working together to write the article - e.g, by exchanging by email subsequent versions of Word documents with track changes enabled - this experiment opened the writing process to anyone interested in the topic, and used the collaborative writing environment of GitHub to facilitate the process.

This current article is an evaluation of that process, again open to anyone interested in the topic.
