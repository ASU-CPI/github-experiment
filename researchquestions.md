The process of writing the original article was structured as a test a number of research questions which are evaluated in this article, namely:

- can an undefined group of writers come together using the GitHub platform to collaboratively author an academic article that is successfully submitted to and accepted by a journal of the group's choosing?
- can discussions amongst the group members be accommodated within the GitHub framework (i.e., the repo's wiki, issues and pull requests)?
- can the article can be written in under 2 months from the date that it is publicly deployed to the date it is submitted to a journal?
- can GitHub's network metrics (e.g., [pulse](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/pulse), [graphs](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/graphs), [network](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/network)), and the evaluation of the group members, be used to determine authorship?
- does being listed as an author provide sufficient incentive for potential authors to contribute?
- can group decisions, including changing any of the "rules of the game", be made by the members of the group using [principles of consensus decision-making](http://consensusdecisionmaking.org/Articles/Basics%20of%20Consensus%20Decision%20Making.html)?
